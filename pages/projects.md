The Copperbelt project is situated in a region historically rich in mineral resources. This area has shown significant potential for copper and silver extraction, with mineralization occurring in stratiform layers within the geological formations. The Copperbelt holds a wealth of untapped resources, making it a prime candidate for further exploration and development. The project is located in a strategically advantageous area, with existing infrastructure that supports easy access and transportation of materials.
