Coppercore mission is straightforward: to discover, recognize, and authenticate abundant copper reserves in Mexico and in the Americas, all while producing top-quality copper ore and/or concentrate.

## Flagship Project

Our flagship project, El Conejo, located in Baja, California, is a highly valuable copper concession with over 100 million tons of potential mining resources at a high grade of 2% Cu at a depth of 100 meters. Additionally, we have the option to expand and double our potential resources. Strategically located just 138 km from the port of Ensenada and approximately a 6-hour drive from the port of San Diego, California, our concession benefits from outstanding weather conditions year-round and is in close proximity to the Pacific ocean and some of the best wine country in Baja California.

## Revolutionizing Sustainable Copper Mining

Rooted in the heart of Baja California, Coppercore is committed to redefining copper mining. Our expertise lies in harnessing Mexico's rich copper deposits and transforming them into top-tier copper ore and concentrate. Balancing innovative mining practices with a respect for our surroundings, our endeavor supports local communities and promotes sustainable mining, all while propelling the world towards a copper-fueled future.
